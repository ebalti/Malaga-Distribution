# Malaga Distribution
This is a code package related to the follow scientific article:
E. Balti, M. Guizani, B. Hamdaoui and B. Khalfi, "[Aggregate Hardware Impairments Over Mixed RF/FSO Relaying Systems With Outdated CSI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8118139)," in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 66, no. 3, pp. 1110-1123, March 2018.

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces the analytical and Monte Carlo simulation of Malaga distribution.

# Content of Code Package
This package contains 2 files: 

1- "malagaPDF.m" returns the analytical expression of the probability density function (PDF) of Malaga distribution.

2- "main.m" validates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) by comparing the analytical and Monte Carlo simulations.

See each file for further documentation.
